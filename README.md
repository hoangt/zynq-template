# Template design for ZYNQ ZC702 and ZC706

Contents:

* Processing system instance with DDR and Ethernet access
* Linux, root file system and bootloader

Both hardware and software binaries are generated through scripts for Vivado which can be used as template to start a new design.

Tested with Vivado 2015.2.
